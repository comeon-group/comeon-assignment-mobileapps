Our client has requested a simple Casino Games app that lists the available games on the opening screen and allows users to navigate through the game detail page where users can see relevant game content. And our team's duty is to complete this task ASAP and provide a demo app to our client.
While analyzing the client's brief, one of our App team members had a 'brilliant' idea that we can make use of a Game listing web page that our Frontend team had implemented with Web technologies (React, TS etc.) So in order to complete the project, we have decided to make use of this Website. It is good that we got rid of reimplementing game listing page but there are still missing requirements for the given tasks and we need to completed them in native side. You may find the remaining tasks to implement, in below. Please note that since we are making use of a shared Web Page project we want to alter web part's code  minimally. 



1) Our client thought that putting a bar on top of the Game listing page would allow users to identify which part of the page they are in, making navigation easier to understand. 
2) Our client asked us to show the number of games in the navigation bar that we show on top of our game listing page.
3) When a user taps on the arrow icon of any game, the user should be navigated to the game detail page. The detail page must show : 
- Game's name on top of the detail page
- Game's description inside a card with a white background.
- Game's theme color as the background color of Game Detail page.
